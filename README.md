hasbi - Hopefully A Slightly Better Interface (for Touch Screens)
=====
*hasbi* is an attempt to create a touch friendly application launcher for Linux. Right now it's a clone of the Windows 8 "Metro" UI start menu.

Right now the only way to close the menu is by clicking on your name in the top right hand corner, or launching an application.

You can launch the *hasbi* start menu by running `./hasbi startmenu` and the switcher by `./hasbi applicationswitcher`.
