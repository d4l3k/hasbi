hasbi - Hopefully A Slightly Better Interface (for Touch Screens)
=====
*hasbi* is an attempt to create a touch friendly application launcher for Linux. Right now it's a clone of the Windows 8 "Metro" UI start menu.

Right now the only way to close the menu is by clicking on your name in the top right hand corner, or launching an application.
